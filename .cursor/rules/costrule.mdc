This is a Survey Server that allows users to share opinions on various areas in free text, which is then analyzed and summarized by AI.
A survey is defined by a survey guidelines - basically a prompt to a LLM explaining what the survey is about, which response domains are permitted, what type of responses are permitted, and how to summarize the survey.
For example:
Survey area: improving the elementary school playground
Survey expiry date: 20 days
survey question: how would you like to improve the school playground?
permitted domains: what we want to keep, what we want to improve
permitted responses: use proper language, limit your response to two paragraphs.
summary instructions: make the summary readable by 6-8 graders, and introduce some humor.
Another example:
Survey area: SWOT (strength/weakness/opportunity/threat) analysis of our organization
Survey expiry date: 20 days
survey question: provide a SWOT analysis of our organization from your viewpoint
permitted domains: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
permitted responses: no need to relate to competitor Z who went out of business.
summary instructions: summarize the insights without adding any interpretation on the position of other competitors.
The server stores all information about surveys and responses in a database.
Users are allowed to:
create surveys in any area
contribute to any survey running on the server, and
change their responses on open surveys until surveys expire or are closed (only by the creator).
The server has a natural language search endpoint, which operates as follow:
E.g., find me all the surveys that relate to food.
In the background, the server will create a context (all surveys with ids), prepare a prompt to LLM to search the surveys, and send the request to LLM.
The result would be a list of survey ids, and a short reason why this survey matches the query.
Server creator can operate on Summarize survey endpoint:
Works in the same manner
The summary is stored with the survey, and is then viewable by all users.
The creator can ask for a summary at any point in time, and show or hide it at will.
Validate user responses - upon request from the survey creator, based on the instructions in the prompt guidelines and the proposed response, asking the LLM to verify adherence.
The result would be a list of { surveyId, responseId, reason }
Survey creator can remove those responses if required.
