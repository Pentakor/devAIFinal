## How the Team Split the Work
The work was divided among all team members. Throughout the development process, everyone had the opportunity to engage with every aspect of the project. It is difficult to define specific areas of responsibility for each member, as all of us contributed to all parts of the development. Much of the work was done collaboratively through group and pair programming on a single device.

## How and Where AI Tools Were Used
We primarily used Cursor and its AI agent features. Contextual rules were added to the tool to enhance its accuracy and relevance in decision-making. Additionally, we used ChatGPT throughout the development process. However, due to a global outage of the ChatGPT service, we had to temporarily switch to using the Claude platform.

We also integrated AI into our project using the OpenAI Completions API.

## Lessons Learned and Challenges Faced
The main challenge we faced was time management. The project was large in scope, and most team members had very limited availability. One team member was on intensive reserve military duty (miluim), another was unavailable due to the Eid al-Adha holiday, and others had to focus on workshop presentations held during the first week of June.

Despite these challenges, we learned to work efficiently under pressure and gained experience with several new tools, including the OpenAI API, Swagger, and various testing frameworks required by the course.
