## How the Team Split the Work
The work was divided among all team members except one. Throughout the development process, everyone had the opportunity to engage with every aspect of the project. It is difficult to define specific areas of responsibility for each member, as we all contributed to every part of the development. Much of the work was done collaboratively through group and pair programming on a single device.

If it is necessary to name the main areas of responsibility for each member:

David – Set up the environment (API route declarations, file hierarchy), implemented the AI integration, and worked on the frontend.

Sapir – Handled frontend initialization, and wrote tests.

Irad – Focused on testing, the backend's internal logic and bug fixes.

Lahav – Despite being actively involved in reserve military duty, he managed to contribute to testing and backend logic.

Adam – Unfortunately, Adam refrained from participating and contributed very little to the development. Despite repeated efforts by the team to involve him, his engagement remained minimal.


## How and Where AI Tools Were Used
We primarily used Cursor and its AI agent features. Contextual rules were added to the tool to improve its accuracy and relevance in decision-making. Additionally, we used ChatGPT throughout the development process. However, due to a global outage of the ChatGPT service, we temporarily switched to using the Claude platform.

We also integrated AI into our project via the OpenAI Completions API.


## Lessons Learned and Challenges Faced
The main challenge we faced was time management. The project was broad in scope, and most team members had very limited availability. One team member was on intensive reserve military duty (miluim), and another contributed almost nothing to the project, what left us with a three members team thought most of the time. Later on, during the Iranian attack on the night of 14th of June, Sapir's house was damaged, which led to further delay.

Another major challenge was setting up JEST. We encountered significant issues with this tool due to the ES6 module system.

Despite these difficulties, we learned how to work efficiently under pressure and gained valuable experience in collab
